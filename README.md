Ludum Dare 41 - Combine 2 Incompatible Genres

My primary goal for this jam was to make something in Unity, and learn Inky script while I was at it. On that note, I succeeded and had fun.

On the goal of actually having a playable game, not so much.

The theme for this jam was "Combine 2 Incompatible Genres". Since I was locked in with something text based, I decided to attempt to make a text based RTS. I envisioned a commander only getting updates on the war via letters delivered by messenger. I think the idea has potential, however I didn't have enough jam (heu heu heu) to get it done.

The two most interesting files are [StoryScript.cs](https://github.com/Pellanor/LD41/blob/master/Assets/StoryScript.cs) and the beautifully named [Test.ink](https://github.com/Pellanor/LD41/blob/master/Assets/Ink/Test.ink).

You can find a web version of the game [here](http://valsarn.com/ludum_dare/ld41/) if you want to spend a minute training units that can't do anything.
